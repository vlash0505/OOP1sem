<h1>1 part: Generic graph implementation.</h1>

        <p>
        (****) + (*) + (*) + (*) + (*)
        (****) Implemented generic graph DS both with adjacency list and adjacency matrix(I 
        used abstract class for shared functionality), (all methods that are required for me 
        to have are, in fact, implemented: graph initialization, vertex/edge addition/deletion, 
        checking for vertex's/edge's presence, checking for graph's connection and other 
        utility methods).
        BFS, DFS, Shortest path algorithm for unweighted graph(we assume that all edges are
        equally weighted).
        
        Bonus tasks:
        (*) for shortest path finding algorithm(as it's for unweighted we assume that all edges are
        equally weighted).
        (*) for graph visualization(of shortest path).
        (*) for documentation (JavaDoc)
        (*) for unit tests (JUnit5)

<h1>2 part: Database that operates on books.</h1>
        
        <p>
        (***) + (*) + (*)
        (***) Implemented a simple C.R.U.D application using Spring Framework and 
        Jpa Repository functionality.
        Project is built with Maven, to operate on database we use SQL and JPA
        features.
        
        Bonus tasks:
        (*) Database implementation.
        (*) Framework usage
        (*) Documentation.
