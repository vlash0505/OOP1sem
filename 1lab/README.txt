1 part: Basic Graph implementation with generics.

        Implemented both with adjacency list and adjacency matrix.
        To find the path between vertices we use methods from two classes
        named BreadthFirstPath and DepthFirstPath(that use BFS and DFS 
        respectfuly).
        
        GRAPH API: 
        _____________________
        Graph() -                   constructor that creates an empty graph.
        int V()-                    method that returns number of vertices;
        int E()-                    method that returns number of edges;
        void addEdge(T v, T w)-     add edge in the graph.
        Iterator<Integer> adj(T v)- adj. vertices to the given vertex.
        String toString() -         representing as string.
        
        Comments are generated with the help of JavaDoc.
        Unit tests are provided with the help of JUnit 5.
       
2 part: Database that operates on books.
        Implemented a simple C.R.U.D application using Spring Framework.
        Project is built with Maven, to operate on database we use SQL and 
        JDBC.
        
 More features: to be done.
