Plan:
First commit(Beta 0.1): basic graph representation using adjacency list, BFS, DFS, path from vertex to vertex, comments 
	      generated with the help of JavaDoc. Simple frame implemented with Java GUI tools, yet without 
	      any functionality.

Second commit(Beta 0.2): added graph representation using adjacency matrix, interface that describes Graph Data structure,
	       organised frame, now we can initialise graph instances and operate on them through Java's GUI.
	       Added convertion from adjacency list to adjacency matrix. Alongside with previous actions, 
	       I started using JUnit 5 for testing code.
	       

Third commit(Beta 0.3): Added constructor for a graph that reads input from file. Modified GUI. Now we can create 
	      vertecies and edges in GUI and see it.

Fourth commit(Alpha 1.0): Small bug fixes, final release.
